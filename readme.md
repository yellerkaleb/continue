PROJECT
---------------------------
---------------------------
The project created is extremely simple. It is a vanilla js, html and css "AI Web Site Creator".

First off, it's not AI. Too little time to even include a simple API call to chatGPT API, which would require you to provide a key for the demo to work. 

I wanted to provide a demo with the least amount of dependencies or effort. 

So I settled, for the idea of an "AI" app builder. 

Why?! Because I can foresee Continue evolving/expanding into an AI application builder for non-technical users. 

In the demo, you click on "create website", and it will generate and download files for site to work out of the box. 

Imagine what can be achieved using AI, even if only API calls, to build apps.  

*I initially set out to build an AI notebook to train Places (POI) dataset to recognize locations based on descriptions. Unfortunately, I struggled with the continue extension, it kept on pasting code instead of the selection desired. 


FEEDBACK
---------------------------
---------------------------
PROS
- Great for short/task specific functions
- Nice for auto-complete
- Can be good for complicated functions
- Time saver, no more stack overflow
- Great for beginners or new language learning

CONS
- Sometimes innacurate functions, requiring excess revision, that makes it more time consuming to resolve than simply writing from scratch
- Auto-complete can be annoying
- No context
- Too many suggestions, requiring excess reading
- Design/integrattion into IDE
- Explanation should be optional, as it takes a lot of real estate, when not necessarily wanted/needed


BUGS
---------------------------
---------------------------
Copy/paste mentioned earlier. 
I copied code (CODE#1) from Continue, pasted into the code section of notebook (AI), ran notebook code segment, got error, tried to copy the error back into Continue text box, instead, it kept pasting CODE#1 into new code segments. Hence I was unable to complete AI notebook using continue as assistant. So, I swtiched to simple project attached (to test Continue).


SUGGESTIONS
---------------------------
---------------------------
First and foremost, way to go!!!!!!!!!  Great job.

I know the struggles of improving, building functionality, design, performance, reliability and feedback/acceptance. So please accept all feedback as constructive. 

Compared to competition, I think both copilot and codieum have had significantly more resources, funding and time developing their product. So, we have lots of work ahead!!! :)

I think all extensions I've used for coding assistance need massive redesigns. 

The interface should be more user friendly, less cluttered, suggestions should be EVEN MORE accurate, CONTEXT is badly needed. As it stands, coding assistance give you a good run, you need an engineer more than ever, since it's harder debugging than it is to code. 

An AI IDE is definitely in the works...Devon for one, I'm sure Microsoft is up to something. 

Continue is good when you initiate a project. Great, I've got starting code. But then, it gets busy fast. If I need to fix something within code, and want Continue to suggest something, then it messes up the serialization (workflow). In other words, often I'm repeating the entire task/function from scratch, so that I dont have to look for the bug, or replacement section. 

Anyway, it's a lil difficult to verbalize everything, but I hope it gives you some feedbcak. 

Again, kudos!!!
