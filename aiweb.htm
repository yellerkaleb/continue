  This is a simple website creator that allows you to create a website with a click.

  The idea is to make it easy for NON-TECHNICAL users to create their own website using AI. 

  Note: no AI is used in this project.
  
  It is more about where CONTINUE could evolve its product in the future for non-technical users.
